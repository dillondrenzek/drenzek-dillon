			.body
				p I design, code, and enjoy beautiful things. I recently graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in Computer Science, but that doesn't mean I've stopped learning. In fact, that means I get to spend more time learning the things I do want to learn. I'm glad you're here - whatever brings you - and I hope you'll reach out and we can talk, work, or even play together. Cheers!
